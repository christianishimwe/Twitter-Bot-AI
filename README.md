# Twitter-Bot-AI

Project Overview

This project involved building a machine learning model and creating an AI capable of generating realistic tweets, using Java. 
The objective was to simulate the behavior of a Twitter bot that can post content indistinguishable from human-written tweets. 
This was achieved by employing techniques such as natural language processing and statistical modeling.

**Features**

Machine Learning Model: Developed a custom machine learning model to analyze and learn patterns from a large dataset of tweets.

Tweet Generation: Implemented algorithms to generate tweets based on the learned patterns, ensuring they mimic the style and structure of real tweets.

Java Programming: Leveraged Java to handle data processing, model training, and tweet generation, reinforcing object-oriented programming skills.

Natural Language Processing: Applied NLP techniques to parse and understand tweet data, enabling the bot to create contextually relevant content.

Statistical Analysis: Utilized statistical methods to assess the similarity between generated tweets and real tweets, fine-tuning the model for improved realism.



**Skills Developed**

Java Programming: Enhanced proficiency in Java, focusing on data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented design principles.

Machine Learning: Gained hands-on experience in building and tuning machine learning models, specifically tailored for natural language generation.
